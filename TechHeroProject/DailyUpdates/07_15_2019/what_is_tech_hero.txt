I love smart home products. Currently in my own home, i have multiple smart light bulbs
Smart devices have changed my life completely. I have incorporated it in my daily routine from
me asking alexa what the weather is like so i can dress accordingly to asking alexa to turn on my
favorite star lamp that brightens the entire room. I wanted to create a platform where people
can also make their day to day lives easier with smart devices.
